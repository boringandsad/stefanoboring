“Hi Jack” wants to show how our on-line activity, amplified by behavioural advertising, is acting as a proxy checking, changing and piloting our knowledge. Using Hi Jack every web page appears with the same single image: symbol of an obsessive state that runs out in a repetition of the same problems and that never investigates the causes and consequences of the facts but ends up creating obsession rather than analysis. Our work explores how on-line activity through behavioural advertising can reduce, rather then expand, our knowledge during web surfing, and brings to an obsessive and limited vision of life.
