Tank man 2 is a polysemous work; the meanings, each fitting inside
another, give life to a new matrioska, composed of different
elements. It’s most immediate meaning sounds a warning: dictatorship
is a reality, freedom doesn’t exist, guerilla warefare goes on daily.

The present-day dictatorship is that of useless machines, fruitless
actions, of the cognitive metaphor asserting “big and expensive is
beautiful”. While observing the image, we run up against a confusion
concerning where to direct our understanding of it: who is tank man,
is he the man standing in front if the tank/hummer, or the man sitting
inside? Is it not ironic that the anonymous citizen, who puts his own
body against a row of tanks, ends up being defined through those same
tanks, becoming himself a tank man? Moreover, tank man 2 is not an
unidentifiable person, nor does he aim to be. Yet, tank man was and
remains anonymous, despite the restless efforts to be identified. It’s
probably because of his anonymity that his act is meaningful both as a
political action and as a mere gesture. By being nobody, tank man is
everyone. On the other hand, tank man’s 2 clear identity is likely to
empty his own act, swallow up its meaning.
