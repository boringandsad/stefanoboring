It is a political work. The performance consists of sending the text
of Antonio Tabucchi “Sostiene Pereira” to three cultural page managers
of three different newspapers. In fact, the protagonist of the story
of Tabucchi is a person in charge of the cultural page: a distracted
journalist, so closed in his private that he lost the social mission
of his work. We called it sa-end for an omen that turned out to be
true. It was a sandy expedition and sanded: no one thanked us, even if
our address was on the envelope.
