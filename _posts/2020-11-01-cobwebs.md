_Cobwebs_ is a reflection on the mechanisms of distortion and
remodelling of facts operated by memory. It consists of the
representation in images of three interviews with three brothers
telling what they remember of a significant event that happened 40
years before.

How much does the need to make sense of one’s story distort memory?
What do you remember about something you did and that you judge
reprehensible? Can memory overturn the roles of the protagonists in a
story? How much does the memory change depending on the role played in
the story?

# Technical description

The work consists of three videos and three images mounted in series
on light-boxes. The audio track of each video is one witness’s
interview. The visual part represents an image that is progressively
composed (based on the interviews: Ciro in 4'59", Maria in 5'10",
Vincenzo in 7'43") and which is nothing more than the image of the
fact created via software.

The software generates the image by looking at two types of data from
the stories: the main events, that are mapped to a unique random
number; the year on which they occurred. Each of this couple of values
is a point, placed on the visual plane using the polar coordinate
system and is mirrored in its four quadrants.

All points are connected by curves that create a sort of web providing
a unique representation of each tale.
